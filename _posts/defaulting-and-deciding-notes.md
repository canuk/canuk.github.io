# Post 3: Defaulting and Deciding (working title)

## Core idea
The underlying skill beneath both comprehension debt and possibility debt is the same thing: the ability to consciously scope. Deciding what you're *not* going to do, what you're *not* going to understand right now, and being deliberate about it rather than letting it happen by default.

## Key threads to pull on

**Defaulting vs. deciding.** On an empty Saturday, you default into fragmentation. When you run a pre-flight checklist, you've decided in advance what matters. The behavior looks different but the underlying skill is the same—one is passive, the other is active. The question isn't "how do I do less" but "how do I choose what to do before the moment of doing."

Reuben's instinct: "Most decisions I don't have strong opinions about, as long as they were intentional."

**Timeboxing as a forcing function.** The 37signals six-week cycle, Gawande's ninety-second checklist pause points, the `/recap` command—they all impose an artificial boundary that forces a decision. The skill isn't the timebox itself, it's learning to trust that a constraint will produce better outcomes than open-ended possibility.

**The "one thing" discipline.** Not "what are all the things AI can do for your classroom" but "what is the one thing you're going to try, and what does done look like?"

**Can AI help us scope?** The paradox: the tool that creates infinite possibility helping you constrain possibility. But maybe that's exactly where AI is most useful—not as a builder but as a mirror that asks "wait, why are you doing this right now?" This is upstream of planning. Planning assumes you've already decided what to work on. Scoping is the act of deciding.

**Is scoping teachable?** Or is it something people only learn by experiencing the failure of not scoping? (The way Reuben learned from empty Saturdays.)

## How it connects to the series
- Post 1 (Comprehension Debt): What are you responsible for that you don't understand?
- Post 2 (Possibility Debt): What happens when you can do everything and finish nothing?
- Post 3 (Defaulting and Deciding): The skill that addresses both—conscious scoping

## New command idea: `/scope`

```
Before I start, help me scope this work.

1. What am I actually trying to accomplish right now?
2. What does "done" look like—specifically?
3. What am I deliberately NOT doing in this session?
4. Is this the most important thing I could be working on,
   or am I defaulting into it?

Push back if my scope is too broad or if I don't have a
clear definition of done.
```

## Meta note
We almost wrote this post immediately after finishing post 2, which would have been a perfect demonstration of possibility debt. Decided to capture the idea and come back to it instead. Practice what you preach.
