I've been accumulating a lot of comprehension debt lately.

I'll be building something—an app, an artifact, a tool for a workshop—and the AI will one-shot it. It works. I don't fully understand how, but it works. I don't even stop and ask the AI to explain it to me. It's so tempting to just... move on.  

So I do.

I came across [a Twitter thread](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2015883857489522876) that gave me language for this feeling. Andrej Karpathy—former AI lead at Tesla, one of the most respected voices in machine learning—was describing how his coding workflow has shifted. He's now 80% "agentic coding," letting AI write the code while he directs in plain English.

[Jeremy Wei replied](https://x.com/jeremytwei/status/2015886793955229705) with a question:

> "Do you find yourself accumulating 'comprehension debt' where it's often quite tedious to review all the code AI has written so over time you understand less and less of the code in your codebase? Any ideas for how to combat this?"

[Karpathy's response](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2015887919924617657):

> "Love the word 'comprehension debt', haven't encountered it so far, it's very accurate. It's so very tempting to just move on when the LLM one-shotted something that seems to work ok."

No solution. Just acknowledgment.

Well, at least I'm in good company.

The phrase stuck with me. *Comprehension debt.* It's a perfect name for something I'd been feeling but hadn't articulated.

We all know technical debt—the shortcuts in code you'll have to fix later. Comprehension debt is its sneakier cousin. Technical debt lives in the codebase. You can see it, grep for it, pay it down intentionally.

Comprehension debt lives in your head. Or rather, it doesn't. Which is the problem.

I'm also a pilot. And one of the things they drill into you in flight training is systems knowledge. You need to understand how your aircraft works—not just how to operate it, but *how it works*. Because if something fails at 8,000 feet, you can't pull over to the side of the sky and call a mechanic.

But I don't understand my car's transmission at all. Could probably give a general explanation if I stopped and really thought about it, but I don't really care. And that's fine. If something breaks, I pull over, I call Triple-A. The stakes are different. The debt is acceptable.

Same person. Different contexts. Different tolerance for not understanding.

So where do AI tools fall on that spectrum?

I build things with AI and I teach others to build things with AI. That dual role is starting to make me twitchy. When I vibe-code a weekend project for myself, who cares if I don't fully understand the code? But when I'm helping educators build AI tools they'll use with students... that feels like a different altitude.

Here's what I keep coming back to: comprehension debt gets dangerous when you assume someone else will pay it.

"The vendor will handle bugs."

"IT will deal with security."

"Someone smarter than me approved this."

Sometimes those assumptions are fine. Division of labor is how complex systems work. But with AI, the assumptions are shakier than ever. The tools are new. The failure modes are still emerging. And the people you're assuming will cover your debt? They might be racking up their own.

In my own work teaching AI literacy, I focus on peeling back the surface layer—helping people understand what's happening behind the scenes when they interact with these tools. How do language models actually work? What are they doing when they "think"? Why do they hallucinate?

But I've realized there's something I haven't been addressing: how to recognize when you're accumulating comprehension debt, how to figure out who actually pays when it comes due, and how to make a conscious decision about whether that's acceptable.

That's the skill. Not "understand everything" (impossible) or "don't worry about it" (reckless). It's the judgment to calibrate.

I don't have a tidy framework yet. I'm working on one. But I keep coming back to this question:

**What are you responsible for that you don't understand?**

If you've never asked yourself that, you're accumulating debt without knowing the interest rate—or when the payment comes due.
